**Project Description** - Mmm Good Burger is a full-stack web application. The user types into the text box the name of a burger they would like to devour. Once submitted, the burger is written to the database and appears in the left column. The user can then click on the devoured button in order to switch the burger over to the right. In the database, the devoured boolean is switched from true to false which signals the app to perform the transfer.
